\section{Brief Introduction}
You have Snapsack which has a \textit{Capacity}: $C_s$. There are some goods, each one has a \textit{Capacity i}:  $C_i$, and has a \textit{Value i}:  $V_i$. 
You choose goods combination which fit the snapsack by Capacity, and maximize the total value.
fit  
In accordance to different constrains, there are 4 categories of Snapsack problem.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fractional Snapsack}: the goods can be split to small part. 
    \item \textbf{0-1 Snapsack}: each item must be taken entirely or left out.
    \item \textbf{Unbounded Snapsack} (Complete Snapsack): each item can be taken as many quantity as you like. 
    \item \textbf{bounded Snapsack}: similar to Unbounded Snapsack, each item has a \textit{maximum quantity} $k_i$ can be taken.
    \item \textbf{others variances}: the Capacity may be Multi-dimensional.
\end{itemize}

\section{Solution}
\subsection{Fractional Snapsack}
\textbf{Greedy algorithm}: take the items by \textbf{value per Capacity}.
\subsection{0-1 Snapsack}
All the other Snapsack should be solved by \textbf{DP}. 

Let $ dp[i][j] $ denote the maximum value achievable using the first $i$ items with a knapsack capacity $j$.

State Transition Equation:
\[
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1]][j],\ dp[i - 1][j - C_i] + V_i)
\]

Complexity:


Time Complexity: $\mathit{O}(nC)$

Space Complexity: $\mathit{O}(C) $ when using the optimized 1D approach
\begin{minted}{python}
for i from 1 to n:
    for j from W down to w_i:
        dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - w_i] + v_i)

\end{minted}
